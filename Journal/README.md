# AI Journal

## What it Does
The AI Journal automatically generates a daily performance journal for your crypto portfolio.  
It highlights portfolio movement, best and worst trades, and gives personalized insights for the day.

## How it Works
- Takes portfolio and trade data (mock data for now, but later can be connected via APIs).  
- Calculates overall portfolio movement (average % change).  
- Identifies best and worst trades.  
- Generates a journal entry with insights.  
- Displays results inside a popup window (easy to read, user-friendly).

## Example Output
AI Journal – 25 August 2025  

- Your portfolio moved by an average of **3.07%** today.  
- Best trade: **ETH/USDT** (+7.0%).  
- Worst trade: **SOL/USDT** (-3.0%).  
- BTC makes up **60%** of your portfolio, which suggests high concentration.  
- Diversifying your assets may help reduce risk.  

Overall, the portfolio showed positive performance today.  

## How it Can Fit into StrateFai
- Add a button → **“Generate Daily Journal”** on the dashboard.  
- Show the generated journal in a popup/modal for each user.  
- Save the journal entries under each user’s profile (like a diary of trades).  
- Later, enhance with features like risk analysis, market sentiment, and AI-driven suggestions.

## Why it’s Useful
- Helps users track daily performance automatically.  
- Gives traders quick insights without manual note-taking.  
- Adds personalization to StrateFai (each user gets their own daily journal).  
- Can evolve into a performance + strategy recommendation engine.
